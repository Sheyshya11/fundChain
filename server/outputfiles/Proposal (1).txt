Blockchain is a way of keeping track of things that happen on the internet. For example, when you send or receive money online, or when you buy or sell something online, or when you play a game online. These things are called transactions, and they are very important to remember.

But how do we remember these transactions? We can’t just write them down on a piece of paper, because someone might lose it or change it or lie about it. We need a better way of remembering these transactions. That’s where blockchain comes in.

Blockchain is like a big book that has many pages. Each page has a list of transactions that happened on the internet. Each page also has a special code that connects it to the previous page. This code is called a hash, and it is very hard to change or fake. The pages are called blocks, and the book is called a chain. That’s why it’s called blockchain.

The blockchain book is not kept by one person or one company. It is kept by many people and many computers all over the world. They all have a copy of the same book, and they all agree on what the book says. This makes the book very secure and trustworthy. No one can cheat or tamper with the book, because everyone else will notice and stop them.

The blockchain chain can be used for many things, such as:
1.Keeping and sharing money without banks: Imagine you have some coins that you want to save or give to your friends. You can put them in a piggy bank, but then you need someone to help you open it and count the coins. Or you can put them in a big jar with your friends’ names on it, but then someone might take more coins than they should. Blockchain is like a magic jar that keeps track of how many coins each person has and lets them share them easily without anyone cheating or stealing.
2.Sharing messages without censorship: Imagine you want to tell your friends something important, like what you did today or what you learned at school. You can write it on a piece of paper and pass it around, but then someone might tear it up or change what you wrote. Or you can say it out loud, but then someone might tell you to be quiet or not listen to you. Blockchain is like a magic megaphone that lets you say whatever you want and makes sure everyone hears it and remembers it exactly as you said it.
